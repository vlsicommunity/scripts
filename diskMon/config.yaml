# Disk Monitor Configuration File
# ================================
# This file configures the disk usage monitoring and alerting system.

# Email Configuration
email:
  # Domain for user email addresses (userid@domain)
  domain: "nxp.com"
  
  # Sender email address for alerts
  sender: "harishkumar.rajendrababu@nxp.com"
  
  # Size unit for displaying disk usage in emails
  # Options: TB, GB, MB (default: TB)
  size_unit: "TB"
  
  # List of administrators/managers who receive consolidated email
  # These emails receive a summary of ALL monitored disks
  administrators:
    - "harishkumar.rajendrababu@nxp.com"
    #- "manager@company.com"
    # Add more administrators as needed
    # - "ops-team@company.com"

  # Path to log file (can be absolute or relative)
  file: "disk_monitor.log"
  
  # Log level: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR
  level: "INFO"

# Performance Configuration
performance:
  # Maximum parallel threads for du calculation
  # Set to a number to cap workers, or remove/comment out for auto-calculation
  # Auto mode: workers = min(num_directories, cpu_count * 2), capped at 16
  # max_workers: 8  # Uncomment to set a fixed limit
  
  # Try to use disk quotas if available (much faster than du)
  # Set to false to always use du command
  use_quotas: true
  
  # Timeout in seconds for each du command per directory
  # Increase for very large directories
  du_timeout: 30000

# Disk Configurations
# Each disk entry requires:
#   - path: The filesystem path to monitor
#   - name: Human-readable name for the disk (used in alerts)
#   - usage_limit_percent: Alert threshold (0-100)
disks:
  # Example disk configuration
  - path: "/home/mx969_f1_be_sta_w01/users/"
    name: "IMX96F1 STA Disk1"
    usage_limit_percent: 70
  # Add more disks as needed
  - path: "/home/mx969_f1_be_sta_w51/users/"
    name: "IMX96F1 STA Disk2"
    usage_limit_percent: 60
